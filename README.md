# A Terminal File Browser
This is my first completed project in C, please don't judge too harshly.

## Features
- Neat terminal interface with nice navigation between folders
- Display all files and folders in the current directory
- List of directories set in a config file to the side for quick access
- Help screen!
- Filter files and folders by typing!

## AI Usage
As I have barely used C before this, I used chatGPT for learning how to do stuff; basically just a second Google. I did take entire chunks of code for platform specific things, those being getting a single character input, reading folders and finding a configuration directory (because I was crazy enough to not have any external libraries). But I wrote over quite a lot of that, and everything else was all of my own creation.
