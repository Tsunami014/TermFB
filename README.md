# A Terminal File Browser
The terminal is for performing actions on files (or running commands) and the file browser is for looking through your files. Why not combine these 2 into one super application?

This is my first completed project in C, please don't judge too harshly

AI generated all of `getch` and most of `listdir`, but that's just because these are utility functions, not the actual program (that was all me)

## Features
- Visual file browser
- Mouse and keyboard support for navigation
- Open files with a default command specified in configuration
- Run commands with files!
